<p> Bio: A Dutch-South African kickboxer, serving in the South African Army for a period of time before exiting after a dishonorable discharge for criminal activity </p>
<p> and corruption. After the service, he began to take kickboxing more seriously, eventually learning Taekwondo for a more fluid stance and grasp on kicking from </p>
<p> obscure angles. His discharge didn't stop him from illegal activity however, as he became a mercenary for insurgencies globally. He would frequently get into </p>
<p> trouble because of it and stray farther from his morals. </p>
