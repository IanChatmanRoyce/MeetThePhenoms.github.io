<h2> Meet The Phenoms</h2>
<img src = "lj.png";>
<h1> Lijun Jargalyn </h1>
<p> Height: 5'4" / 162.5 cm. </p>
<p> Weight: 128 lb. / 58 kg. / 9.1 st. </p>
<p id="bt"> Blood Type: <button type="button" onclick="text()">[Redacted]</button>  </p>
<p> Hair Color: Jet Black </p>
<p> Eye Color: Deep Brown </p>
<p> Age: 24 </p>
<p> Nationality: People's Republic of China </p>
<p> Bio: Chinese-born and of Tibetan and Mongolian heritage, he was always a trouble maker, a kind heart shielded by crime and roughed knuckles. He completed </p>
<p> high school out of respect for his parents, joining the PLA to get off the streets, he was then dishonorably dischared there for beating an officer who had </p>
<p> badmouthed him and his mates. Confident in his striking, he decided to learn Sanda while polishing up on skills in Hung-Gar he had learned as a child. He kept </p>
<p> a lot of targets on the streets in check with his striking, and fought professionally for the money globally. A fan of the classics, Lijun purchased a few imposing </p>
<p> firearms, like the "Box Cannon" used to intimidate his rivals in the Chinese underground.</p>
